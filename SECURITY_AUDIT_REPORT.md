# Security Audit Report - WashMates Landing Page

**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Analysis System  
**Repository**: denver20992/washmates-landing

## Executive Summary

A critical security vulnerability was identified where Supabase service role key was exposed in the GitHub repository. This has been addressed, but immediate action is required to rotate the compromised keys.

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Service Role Key Exposure
- **File**: run-schema.mjs (now removed)
- **Line**: 6
- **Impact**: Full database access compromised
- **Status**: File removed, but key rotation required
- **Action Required**: IMMEDIATELY rotate Supabase service role key

## Security Scan Results

### ‚úÖ Positive Findings
1. `.env.local` properly listed in `.gitignore`
2. No sensitive data in current codebase
3. Environment variable structure properly implemented
4. No hardcoded passwords found
5. No private keys detected in current files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Addressed
1. **Removed Files**:
   - `run-schema.mjs` - contained service role key
   - `setup-waitlist.mjs` - contained anon key
   - `test-supabase.mjs` - contained anon key

2. **Created Secure Replacements**:
   - `run-schema-secure.mjs` - uses env variables
   - `setup-waitlist-secure.mjs` - uses env variables
   - `.env.example` - documentation without secrets

## Vulnerability Impact Assessment

### Service Role Key Exposure Risks:
- **Data Breach**: Full read/write access to all database tables
- **Data Manipulation**: Ability to modify/delete any data
- **User Privacy**: Access to all user personal information
- **RLS Bypass**: Row Level Security policies bypassed
- **Schema Changes**: Ability to alter database structure

### Mitigation Timeline:
- ‚úÖ Files removed from repository
- ‚è≥ Git history needs cleaning (requires force push)
- üî¥ Keys need immediate rotation
- ‚è≥ Monitor for unauthorized access

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Hour):
1. **Rotate Supabase Keys**:
   ```
   Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/nbgyqumfkartcpewfuwn/settings/api
   Click: "Generate new JWT secret"
   Update: All applications using these keys
   ```

2. **Check Access Logs**:
   - Review Supabase dashboard for unauthorized access
   - Check for unusual database queries
   - Monitor for data exports

3. **Clean Git History**:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch run-schema.mjs setup-waitlist.mjs test-supabase.mjs" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

### Long-term Security Improvements:

1. **Implement Pre-commit Hooks**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev husky
   npm install --save-dev detect-secrets
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code security
   - Enable secret scanning
   - Enable push protection

3. **Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD**:
   - Store sensitive keys in GitHub Secrets
   - Reference in GitHub Actions only

4. **Implement Key Rotation Policy**:
   - Rotate keys every 90 days
   - Document rotation procedures
   - Use separate keys for dev/staging/prod

5. **Enable Supabase RLS**:
   - Implement Row Level Security on all tables
   - Use anon key for client-side operations
   - Service role only for admin operations

## Security Checklist

- [x] Remove exposed credentials from code
- [x] Create secure script versions
- [x] Add .env.example documentation
- [x] Commit and push fixes
- [ ] Rotate compromised keys
- [ ] Clean git history
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Enable GitHub secret scanning
- [ ] Document security procedures

## Files Reviewed

| File | Status | Risk Level |
|------|--------|------------|
| `.env.local` | In .gitignore ‚úÖ | Safe |
| `*.mjs` scripts | Removed/Secured ‚úÖ | Fixed |
| API routes | Using env vars ‚úÖ | Safe |
| Client components | No secrets ‚úÖ | Safe |
| Configuration files | No secrets ‚úÖ | Safe |

## Conclusion

The immediate threat has been contained by removing the exposed files, but the compromised keys remain active and must be rotated immediately. The repository structure is now secure, using environment variables properly.

**Priority Action**: Rotate the Supabase service role key within the next hour to prevent potential unauthorized access.
